Note: This list is not complete, and there are many more companies out there. This list just represents the company names and positions that I was aware of during my internship search, in no particular order. I was based in the US during this internship search. The preference or minimum qualifications are often updated by the teams depending on the then requirement. Considering the ever-changing market and hiring policies, always check the respective career websites to know about the current open positions and eligibility.
